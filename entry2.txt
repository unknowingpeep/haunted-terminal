JOURNAL ENTRY #2 - OCTOBER 30, 2023

The ghost account has been accessing files it shouldn't. I think 
there's a privilege escalation vulnerability.

Found this in the cookies during debugging:
user_token: 7b24afc8bc80e548d66c4e7ff72171c5
debug_info: user=ghost&level=3

If someone could mimic these cookies... they could access everything.

Note to self: The flag is hidden in /secret, but only the ghost can see it.
Need to fix this cookie validation issue tomorrow.

The whispers are getting louder tonight...
