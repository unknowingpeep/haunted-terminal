JOURNAL ENTRY #1 - OCTOBER 28, 2023

The terminal has been acting strange lately. I keep hearing whispers 
from the speakers when no one is logged in.

Today I found this in the logs:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' -- AND password = '...'
Someone is trying to break in. The security here is... questionable.

TODO: Change password hashing from MD5 to something stronger.
TODO: Fix the SQL queries - they're vulnerable to injection.

I also found this weird hash in the database for the ghost account:
7b24afc8bc80e548d66c4e7ff72171c5
What could it mean?
